# Quick Formula
[QuickFormula](https://github.com/PJ-1997/Formula) This is my first application that I uploaded to the Appstore. This calculates formulas from math and science.

Quick Formula was built entirely in Swift, with no external dependencies, and the UI is created programmatically with no interface builder. Most importantly, the code is clean, easy to reason about, and maintains strong separation of concerns.

# Stock Notify
Sends a push notification when a certain stock reaches a price that the user specified. This requires a back-end server which takes the POST request from the mobile device, then sends the push notification when the price is met.
